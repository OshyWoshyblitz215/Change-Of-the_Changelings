changelings_chancellor.1.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis walked carefully into the room. Her eyes were immediately drawn to the IV bags and then quickly darted to the old scarred changeling lying on the bed. Her uncle, Pronotum Vesal, The Steel Chancellor of Vesalipolis. His pupiled eyes still gleaming with the spark of genius she had seen in him as long as she knew him. \n\n“Hello, Butterfly” He rasped out as she drew closer. She smiled at the private nickname he had given her when she was young.\n\n“Hello Uncle” She sat beside him. “Are you comfortable?” she asked the old changeling Royal. All Royals had extended lifespans, living centuries as long as nothing else ended them. Pronotum Vesal was already at the age of almost 1 and a half centuries and had counselled her grandmother, her mother and finally her. \n\n“Hmmm… yes… I am quite comfortable.” He descended into a coughing fit, after a few seconds coughing he cleared his throat. Chrysalis quickly grabbed a glass of water with her magic and offered it to him, the old changeling’s magic had deteriorated after a failed assassination attempt and by now his limbs were simply too weak to lift themselves. After a quick sip the Steel Chancellor sighed. “Thank you Butterfly… I wish I wasn't leaving yet....” he frowned. \n\n“I'll be fine Uncle.” The two changelings smiled at each other. Pronotum settled into his mattress and pillow. He closed his eyes and Chrysalis watched as the elder changeling’s breath steadily slowed until it stopped. The Queen smiled sadly as she felt her uncle’s life fade. She bowed her head as water droplets splashed onto the carapace of the Steel Chancellor."
